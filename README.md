Hello, I am Phinda Melusi Malaza an informatics student, who is excited to start my journey into the world of development.
As a student, I am passionate about learning new technologies and building projects that will help me grow as a developer.

I'm currently pursuing a certification from Harvard to further deepen my knowledge and skills in programming, 
algorithms and software development. I'm focusing on mastering core concepts in Python and Java. I'm eager to explore new
tools and frameworks along the way.
